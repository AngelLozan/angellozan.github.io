# Chirpy Starter

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders `_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and a small part of options from the `_config.yml` file. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, users need to copy other critical files from the theme's gem to their Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

- `_config.yml`
- `_plugins coatage d_
- `_tabs about.md`
- `index.html`

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

Check out the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki).

If you encounter any issues or want to contribute to its improvement, please visit the [theme repository][chirpy] to provide feedback.
