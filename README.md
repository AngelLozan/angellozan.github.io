Hi and welcome to a brief sample of some of my public work. I like to consider this my portfolio. When I have time I try to document projects I’ve completed along the way or interesting things I’ve learned. I hope you enjoy it. Fee free to visit the site in the description and contact me through there. My socials are also listed. Let me know your questions or if you want to collaborate. I do a lot of work privately for companies, crypto companies and art agencies alike. All dev work. 

This file was generated from a pull request to a mini-moltbot I created by running a local LLM on a Ruby on Rails application from my home server.
